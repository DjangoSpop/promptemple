## 🔧 Environment Variables for Railway

Set these environment variables in your Railway project:

### Required
```bash
DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=promptcraft.settings.production
SECRET_KEY=your-super-secret-key-here
DEBUG=false
```

### Optional (will use fallbacks if not set)
```bash
# Database (will fallback to SQLite if not provided)
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@host:port/database

# Redis (will fallback to in-memory cache if not provided)
REDIS_URL=redis://host:port/0

# Monitoring
SENTRY_DSN=your-sentry-dsn-here
SENTRY_ENVIRONMENT=production

# API Keys
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-key
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your-anthropic-key

# Frontend CORS
FRONTEND_URL=https://your-frontend-domain.com
```

## 🚀 Deployment Steps

### 1. Deploy to Railway

```bash
# Install Railway CLI
npm install -g @railway/cli

# Login to Railway
railway login

# Deploy the project
railway up
```

### 2. Set Environment Variables

In Railway dashboard:
1. Go to your project
2. Navigate to Variables tab
3. Add the required environment variables listed above

### 3. Validate Deployment

After deployment, run the validation script:

```bash
# Local validation
python validate_deployment.py --local

# Remote validation (after deployment)
python validate_deployment.py --url https://your-app.railway.app
```

## 🔍 Health Check Endpoints

- **Simple Health Check**: `/health/` (minimal dependencies)
- **Detailed Health Check**: `/api/v1/core/health/` (full system check)
- **API Documentation**: `/api/schema/swagger-ui/`

## 📊 Key Features Ready for Production

### Real-time Chat Interface
- ✅ SSE streaming at `/api/v2/chat/completions/`
- ✅ JWT authentication for secure access
- ✅ WebSocket support for real-time updates
- ✅ DeepSeek AI integration with streaming responses

### API Endpoints
- ✅ RESTful API with comprehensive documentation
- ✅ Authentication with JWT tokens
- ✅ Rate limiting and throttling
- ✅ CORS properly configured

### Background Processing
- ✅ Celery workers for async tasks
- ✅ Redis message broker
- ✅ Task queuing and retry logic

### Monitoring & Observability
- ✅ Sentry error tracking
- ✅ Comprehensive logging
- ✅ Health monitoring
- ✅ Performance metrics

## 🛠 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Build Failures**
   - Check `requirements.txt` for dependency conflicts
   - Verify Docker build logs in Railway

2. **Runtime Errors**
   - Check environment variables are set correctly
   - Review application logs in Railway dashboard
   - Run `python validate_deployment.py --local` to check configuration

3. **Database Issues**
   - Ensure `DATABASE_URL` is set if using PostgreSQL
   - SQLite fallback will be used if no external database configured

4. **Redis Issues**
   - Ensure `REDIS_URL` is set if using Redis
   - In-memory fallback will be used if Redis unavailable

### Health Check Validation

The deployment includes comprehensive health checks that verify:
- Database connectivity
- Cache functionality
- File storage access
- API endpoint availability
- Environment configuration

## 🔐 Security Features

- ✅ Production-grade SECRET_KEY handling
- ✅ HTTPS enforcement (Railway handles SSL)
- ✅ Secure headers configuration
- ✅ CORS restriction to trusted domains
- ✅ Rate limiting on API endpoints
- ✅ JWT token security with blacklisting

## 📱 Frontend Integration

The API is configured to work with your Next.js frontend:

```javascript
// Example API call from frontend
const response = await fetch('https://your-app.railway.app/api/v2/templates/', {
  headers: {
    'Authorization': `Bearer ${jwt_token}`,
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
  }
});
```
